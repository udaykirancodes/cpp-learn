<!-- OOPS -->
<!-- Object Oriented Programming Style - OOPS -->
Class : Basic template for creating objects.
Objects : Basic run time entities. 
Data Abstraction & Encapsulation : Wrapping data and function into single unit 
Inheritance : Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
Polymorphism : Ability to take more than one forms. 

class Employee {
    public:
        int a,b,c; 
    private:
        int d,e; 
}; 

-> Public Variables can be easily accessed but private variable cannot only avaible with the functions ;

-> OOPS , Classes and Objects ;
-> Class is an extension of the structures 
-> structures has limitations 
    ->Members are public 
    ->No methods 

--> Classes can have methods and properties 
--> Classes can make few members and private & few as public 
--> structures in c++ are typedefed 
--> you can declare objects along with the class declaration like this 

class Employee{
    // class declaration
} uday , kiran ;

uday.salary = 10 , makes no sense if salary is private 


<!-- Nesting of members  -->
using of class methods inside the other methods/functions of the same class ; 

-> static int count ; // now this is a static variable 
Employee :: count --> accessing 
we can access static variables from any obect and any method

<!-- Friend Functions -->
if we make a function as a friend function to a class, 
then that function has access to the private varibles 

Properties of Friend Functions 
1.Not in the scope of the class 
2.since it is not in the scope of the class , it cannot be called from the object of that class 
3.can be invoked withoud the help of any object 
4.usually contains the objects as arguments 
5.can be declared inside public or private section of the class

-> we can give access to any functions of the same class or different class 

<!-- Friend Classes -->
-> we can give access to specific functions of the different class 
-> we can also give access to the entire new class

<!-- Constructor -->
constructor is a special member function with same name as of the class. 
it is used to initialize the objects of its class
It is automatically invoked , whenever object is created ;

-> The constructor which does not access parameters are called Default Constructors
Characteristics :- 
-> It should be declared in the public section of the class 
-> They are automatically invoked , whenever the object is created 
-> They cannot return values and Do not have return types 
-> It can have default arguments 
-> We cannot refer to their address 

<!-- Default Constructor & Parameterized Constructor  -->
-> Default Constructor doesn't take any parameters 
-> Parametarized Constructor takes some parameters to set to the variables of private section  

--> Implicit call 
complex a(1,2); // for parametarized constructors 
a.printNumber(); 

--> Explicit call 
complex b = complex(5,6); 
b.printNumber(); 


<!-- Constructor Overloading -->
-> we can create more than one constructor with the same name 
-> each can be varied with the number of arguments 


<!-- Constructors with default arguments -->
-> we can give default values to the constructors 

<!-- Copy Constructor -->
A constructor which take an object as an input and creates a copy of it 
-> we don't required to write a copy constructor , compiler provides a copy constructor for every class.
-> when there is no copy construcotr is found , compiler suppliles its own copy constructor 
-> Automatically invoked 

<!-- Destructors -->
-> Never takes an orgument not return any value 
-> Used to free the class / object's Memory.
