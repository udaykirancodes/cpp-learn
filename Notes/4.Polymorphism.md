<!-- Polymorphism -->
--> One name multiple Forms

                                                        Function Overloading 
                    compile time polymorphism  ----> 
                                                        Operator Overloading 
Polymorphism  ----> 
                                        
                    run time polymorphism      ---->    Virtual Functons 


Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types 
1.Compile time polymorphism 
    * acheived using :
    1.1 - Function Overloading
    1.2 - Operator Overloading
2.Run time polymorphism 
    * acheived using :
    2.1 - Virtual Functions 


<!-- Pointers to Derived Class -->

we have 2 classes Base & Derived ; 

if base class pointer is pointed to derived class 
and we will try to run functions then , base class functions are invoked (default behaviour)

<!-- Virtual Functions -->
The above default behaviour is changed if we use virtual Keyword for the functions 

-> Default behaviour will be *overwritten
   Run time polymorphism can be acheived in this way 

-> Pointers are used to call the functions 
-> with the help of virtual functions we can call the derived class functions instead of the default behaviour i.e. calling the base class functions 


Rules for Virtual Functions :-
1.They cannot be static 
2.They are accessed by object pointers 
3.Virtual functions can be a friend of another class 
4.A virtual function in base class might not be used.
5.If a virtual function defined in the base class , there is not necessity of redefining it in the derived calss  


<!-- Pure Virtual Functions -->

virtual void display()=0; --> do nothing function --> pure virtual function 

-> pure virtual function means we need to have a function with same definition in the derived class also. 

<!-- Abstract Base class -->

-> definition from internet 
-> all the work/functions need to be declared in the derived class ; 
-> Abstract Base Class musts contains atleast one Pure Virtual Class ;
